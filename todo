1. Make some order to pointInside.py file. Pay more attention to comments.

2. Make changes in standard algorithms to be sm-like (regarding the coding style).

3. x,y instead of P in arguments. It will make all the implementations a bit faster.

4. Try more test cases.

5. Improve wn algoritm (eventally).
