# Point_Inside-Python
The improvement of well known Crossing Number (cn) algorithm determining the inclusion of a point P in a 2D planar polygon. 

This implementation is tested against standard Crossing Number (cn) algorithm, Winding Number (wn) algorithm and the PostGIS implementation (pulled from its source code).

Unlike standard implementations, this one WORKS ON EDGES and it is even faster.
