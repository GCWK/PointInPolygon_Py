The improvement of well known Crossing Number (cn) algorithm determining the inclusion of a point P in a 2D planar polygon. 

This implementation is tested against standard Crossing Number (cn) algorithm, Winding Number (wn) algorithm and the PostGIS implementation.

Unlike standard methods (cn and wn), this one WORKS ON EDGES. Besides, it outperforms other alghoritms here.
