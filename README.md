# Point_Inside-Python
The improvement of well known Crossing Number (cn) algorithm determining the inclusion of a point P in a 2D planar polygon. 

This implementation is tested against standard Crossing Number (cn) algorithm, Winding Number (wn) algorithm and the PostGIS implementation (taken from its source code and translated from C to Python).

Unlike standard implementations, this one WORKS ON EDGES and it is even faster.
