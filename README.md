The improvement of well known Crossing Number (cn) algorithm determining the inclusion of a point P in a 2D planar polygon. 

This implementation is tested against standard Crossing Number (cn) algorithm, Winding Number (wn) algorithm and the PostGIS implementation. <!--img src="http://forum.srpskinacionalisti.com/images/smilies/eusa_snooty.gif" alt="there's a better" height="15" width="16"-->

Unlike standard methods (cn and wn), this one WORKS ON EDGES. Furthermore, according to my tests, it outperforms standard alghoritms.
